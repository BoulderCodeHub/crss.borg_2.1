    - Modified the execution constraint of the Domestic 7 State Plan Level 2 Surplus rule in the Surplus Rules group. 
    
    --The additional execution constraint includes a AND Surplus Triggers.7 State Plan Level 2[@"t-1"] != 1,200.00 "ft". When the Surplus trigger level 2 values is = to 12000 then both the d1 and d2 policy variables are both equal to 0 ft. This policy variable combination leads to surplus operation being "turned off". This added execution constraint allow for this policy variable combination to make this rule not fire.

    -Created a Partial Domestic Surplus (7 State Plan Level 3 No ICS) rule in the Surplus Rules group.
    
    --Structurally, the Partial Domestic Surplus (7 State Plan Level 3 No ICS) rule is similar to the Domestic surplus rule; however it utilizes the ComputeSurplusDiv/Depl7StatePlanLevel3()  functions instead of the Level 2 functions and allows additional Partial Domestic Surplus (PDS) delivery to "MWD" and "SNWP" only. CAP didn't get additional PDS surplus delivery to align what was done in the 2001 Interim Surplus Guidelines.
    
    --There is an execution constraint checks to see which surplus condition Lake Mead's Pool Elevation falls below Level 2 (DS) but above Level 3 (PDS) surplus flags, then this rule will fire.

    - Worked on preparing the CRSS baseline model (CRSS.Borg_2.0_Baseline) and ruleset (CRSS.Baseline.2027IGDCP.v4.4.9004_baseline_DCP_OFF.rls & CRSS.Baseline.2027IGDCP.v4.4.9004_baseline_DCP_ON.rls) for the upcoming comparison runs
    
    --Turned off Upper Basin Drought Ops in the Set ICS Put and Take Dates  in both baseline rulesets.
    --Turned off DCP shortage reduction by setting  the DCP.EndDCP[year] slot in the Set Operational Dates rules  to DateToNumber(@"24:00:00 December 31, 2010") in the Set ICS Put and Take Dates rule and saved this ruleset as "CRSS.Baseline.2027IGDCP.v4.4.0.9004_baseline_DCP_OFF"
    --Renamed the baseline ruleset that left DCP shortage reductions on to "CRSS.Baseline.2027IGDCP.v4.4.0.9004_baseline_DCP_OFF"
    --Deleted the old baseline ruleset

    - Updated the execution constraint for the Re Sort E initilization rule. Now the rule will only fire if the shortage elevations variables are listed in a decending order. The elevation variables are always read into the From BorgRW table in a decending order, so this rule will only fire if the table hasn't been flipped yet.

    - Changed the way IID took CAP shortage reductions. CAP will now take shortage redcutions until going dry and then IID will take the remainder of CAP's shortage reductions after CAP goes dry. Specifically, two functions were created ActualCAPShortage() and IIDShortage(). These functions replaced some of the CAP and IID logic within the ComputeStepShortageDepletion().

    - created Powell Decision Variables.Shifted EQ Storage to have a reference storage for when powell eq release should stop based on being #ft below eq line (currently 20ft b/c we're leaving eq stuff from 2007 IG in place)
    
    - checked BORG eqalization rule by starting EQ tier at 3580 and using 1 ft increment. kept things in this state for now.

    adapted all changes from generic powell release and bottom tier rules to key off of functions instead of table lookups:
    
    - created GetPowellTierNum function to get powell tier num from borg variable table (to avoid double table lookups)
    
    - created GetMeadRefElev function to get powell tier num from borg variable table (to avoid double table lookups)
    
    - created GetPowellPrimaryRel function to feed into PowellReducedRelforCurrentMonth_BORG function
    
    - created GetPowellBalRelRangeNum function to feed into PowellReducedRelforCurrentMonth_BORG_Balancing function
    
    - revised Generic Lake Powell Release Volume rule to use all of the new/revised functions

    - remove constraint "NOT IsNaN EqualizationData.MinObjRelFlag" from rules so i can get rid of min obj release. Alan said it was fine to get rid of it even in non-Borg rules so that's what i did. took it out of every rule above the "Meet Powell Min Objective Release" rule (Borg and non-Borg rules)
    
    - created PowellComputeRunoffSeasonRelease_BORG function so we could refer to the GetPowellReleaseColumnIndex_BORG function
    
    - created PowellRunoffSeasonStorage_BORG so we could refer to the PowellComputeRunoffSeasonRelease_BORG function
    
    - created PowellComputeFallSeasonRelease_BORG function so we could refer to the GetPowellReleaseColumnIndex_BORG function
    
    - created PowellFallSeasonStorage_BORG so we could refer to the PowellComputeRunoffSeasonRelease_BORG function
    
    - created Powell Operations Rule_BORG rule to refer to above functions
    
    - created CheckPowellBalancing function to be able to look up whether a tier has balancing enabled
    
    - fixed Generic Lake Powell Release Volume rule- i used a table lookup to get tier number instead of checking to see if tier allowed for balancing

    - created AnnualMinObjectiveRelease_BORG function to replace static 8.23 w/ min primary rel from borg

commit 24d6ab64e4f83fb1fe26cbbb3482cc4dd79cb3be
Author: rebecca <rebeccasmith@usbr.gov>
Date:   Mon Jun 14 20:35:34 2021 -0600

    - changed the name of the original AnnualMinObjectiveRelease function to say "OG" and called the "_BORG" function just "AnnualMinObjectiveRelease" to minimize the amount of duplicate rules and functions
    
    - renamed original PowellMinObjRelData.Annual Volume slot w/ "_OG" and created a new scalar w/ expression to refer to the dynamic value. just to avoid confusion, not used anywhere
    
    - anywhere there's an "_OG" label on a function it's b/c the untagged function is the borg version. these will always have the black/blue colored text also (started using "_OG" and trading out original name when needed to replace a lot of MinObjRel stuff w/in functions). note that there are many rules and functions that don't look like they've changed b/c they're the same except the sub-functions they refer to are changed.
    
    - created "Powell Operations Rule_BORG" to change the fall season operation to refer to PowellFallSeasonStorage_BORG function
    
    - fixed a few things in the GetPowellPrimaryRel, GetPowellBal... functions
    
    - note that the CheckPowellBalancing function won't work if the bottom row of the first column in From Borg Powell Tier table is NaN. have placeholders in that column for now
    
    - tiers are working at this point, still need to investigate why the OND releases are the values they are

    - changed PowellMinObjRelforCurrentMonth_BORG function to check if it was OND so that it would take the standard rel pattern for those months regardless of min obj rel value and then only adjust jan-sept to meet annual vol
    
    - created BORG version of min obj rel rule

    - changed functions PowellMinObjRelVolumeSpring_BORG and ComputeScheduledMinObjRelRemainingThruSept_BORG  and PowellMinObjRelVolumeFall_BORG from OG versions so they would use the dynamic min obj rel to lookup values in powell monthly rel table
    
    - change bottom tier value from 999 to 13 b/c the table lookup won't work past that number; changed in full table end and beginning and constraint in bottom tier rule
    
    - now all tiers except UEBT should be working
    
    - created rw package to easily load things

    - assuming EOWY forecasting does not need Borg revisions- revisit this
    
    - created PowellUpperTierElevation slot on powell decision variables object to have an easy way to track bottom of UEBT and to keep structure of OG InUpperElevationBalancingTier rule
    
    - created InUpperElevationBalancingTier_BORG function to change references and be dynamic w/ whether a UEBT exists
    
    - created InUpperElevationBalancingTier_BORG function to refer to Borg-related slots and be dynamic
    
    - created StartYearInEqualization_BORG function to refer to the Borg equalization line
    
    - created two UEBT_BORG rules
    
    - created EqualizationConditionsMet_BORG function
    
    - model will run w/ the new UEBT borg rules but not sure what's happening in the uebt tier yet

    ***finished getting UEBT behavior dialed in***
    
    - for UEBT rules added check to see if balancing is turned on (want to be able to have tier right below equalization not balance)
    
    - revised function "AnnualReducedRelease" to point to primary release volume for borg tiers. the original required a column index argument, but the new one does not require an argument so wherever this function is included i revised to remove the column index argument ***this was the critical piece for getting proper interpolation b/t monthly release columns***
    
    - turned off all of the "_OG" functions b/c they wouldn't validate after removing the column index argument from "AnnualReducedRelease" function
    
    - created "PowellReducedRelforCurrentMonth_BORG_Balancing_BottomTier" function which calls "PowellReducedRelVolRemaining_BottomTier" b/c the generic versions use the primary release volume and the bottom tier will not have a primary release volume

Date:   Fri Jul 9 13:48:29 2021 -0600

    - revised july smooth operations constraint on generic release volume rule
    
    - added row to bottom of Powell.Max Turbine Q so that the interpolation wouldn't fail past 568 ft operating head (the original last row). just copied turbine capacity from previous row b/c doesn't seem like it should matter. the reason i did this is b/c the function ComputePowellRelease wasn't returning values if the max constraint wasn't solving. for borg model
    
    - added another row to same table in baseline model but it didn't make any difference. keeping it anyway
    
    - moved "set lake powell release tier" rule to a lower prioirity
    
    - added a UEBT release volume rule so in that tier it would release more than primary release to meet preferred late summer/fall storage levels (brings the "powell operations rule_borg" back so that higher releases can be set when powell is high near EOWY)
    
    - added "Powell Limit Outflow Rule1" to reduce release down to 25,000 cfs if previous rule sets outflow too high

    - removed dummy statement in compressing rule #4
    
    - re-removed collapse index slot from powell dv object
    
    - fixed shifted EQ storage slot to take min of 20ft or EQ line-3370
    
    - added another constraint to elliot's bottom tier IRs to only fire if the last row's tier elevation is 3370. this will ensure that borg can create policies w/o bottom tiers.  this doesn't "add" a bottom tier it, it converts one if borg doesn't fill in every tier. still leaves the variables associated w/ the tier that became the bottom tier as dummies but i think that's unavoidable.
    
    - added "clear these slots" group to powell DV object to remember which things needed to be cleared for testing

    - Updated the Execution constraint in the Bottom Tier rule End to only check to see if the last row in the Powell Pool Elevation column of the From Borg Powell Tier Table is equal to 3370' in order to fire.
    
    - Updated the Powell Decision Variable.Shifted EQ Storage expression slot to work with low Lake Powell Pool Elevations
    - Update the Generic Lake Powell Release Volume execution constraint to see if release tier is less than 13 and is greater than 0
    - Updated the Populating From Borg Powell Tier Table - Powell Release Tier Number Column IR to look up the the tier number from the Powell Full_End table and uses the Powell Pool Elevation from the End_Flipped table as the lookup key
    - Updated the Borg DV input control file so it reads in generic input text files
    - Update the input text files so we have a copy of each of the IG policy variable formulations

    - The following LB shortage fixes were made to the CRSS.Borg_2.0 model:
    
    -- LBShort.SNWPShort expression slot was calculating positive shortage quantities; therefore, I fixed this issue by multiplying the SNWPShort slot's SNWPDiversion;SNWPDiversion.Depletion Schedule Cutback [] by negative 1, so this LB State shortage quantity is aligned with the other LB States and it now calculates correctly at the annual level.
    -- Replaced the summation function in the LBShort.AnnualIIDshort expression slot to now use the SumVolumeMax0 function. Also, changed this slot to calculate at an annual time step (instead of a monthly timestep).
    --The ComputeStepShortageDepletion function was updated so that the IID Shortage function is multiplied by IID's monthly shortage percentage.
